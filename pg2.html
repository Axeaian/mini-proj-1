                    Pilots use radio navigation aids. To ensure that the stations the pilots are using are 
                    serviceable, the stations transmit a set of identification letters (usually a two-to-five-letter version 
                    of the station name) in Morse code. Station identification letters are shown on air navigation charts. 
                    <br><br>
                    Morse is typically sent at a very slow speed of about 5 words per minute. Some modern navigation receivers 
                    automatically translate the code into displayed letters.

                    <strong class="tit">Amateur radio</strong><br> 
                    The original amateur radio operators used Morse code exclusively since voice-capable radio transmitters did not become
                     commonly available until around 1920. Until 2003, the International Telecommunication Union mandated Morse code
                      proficiency as part of the amateur radio licensing procedure worldwide. 
                    <br><br>
                    The relatively limited speed at which Morse code can be sent led to the development of an extensive number of 
                    abbreviations to speed communication. For example, CQ is broadcast to be interpreted as "seek you" (I'd like to converse
                     with anyone who can hear my signal).

                    Morse code has been employed as an assistive technology, helping people with a variety of disabilities to
                     communicate. Morse can be sent by persons with severe motion disabilities, as long as they have some minimal 
                     motor control. An original solution to the problem that caretakers have to learn to decode has been an electronic
                      typewriter with the codes written on the keys.

                    An important application is signalling for help through SOS, "ooo---ooo".
                     This can be sent many ways: keying a radio on and off, flashing a mirror, toggling a flashlight, 
                     and similar methods. SOS is not three separate characters, rather, it is a prosign SOS, and is keyed without 
                     gaps between characters.
