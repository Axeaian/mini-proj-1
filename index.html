                    Morse code is a method of transmitting text information as a series of on-off tones, lights, 
                    or clicks that can be directly understood by a skilled listener or observer without special 
                    equipment.
                    The International Morse Code encodes the ISO basic Latin alphabet, some extra Latin letters, 
                    the Arabic numerals and a small set of punctuation and procedural signals (prosigns) as 
                    standardized sequences of short and long signals called "dots" and "dashes", or "dits" and
                     "dahs", as in amateur radio practice. Because many non-English natural languages use more 
                     than the 26 Roman letters, extensions to the Morse alphabet exist for those languages.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Each Morse code symbol represents either a text character (letter or numeral) or a prosign 
                    and is represented by a unique sequence of dots and dashes. The dot duration is the basic 
                    unit of time measurement in code transmission. The duration of a dash is three times the 
                    duration of a dot. Each dot or dash is followed by a short silence, equal to the dot duration.
                     The letters of a word are separated by a space equal to three dots (one dash), and the words 
                    are separated by a space equal to seven dots.To increase the speed of the communication, 
                    the code was designed so that the length of each character in Morse is approximately inverse
                     to its frequency of occurrence in English. Thus the most common letter in English, the 
                     letter "E", has the shortest code, a single dot.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    In an emergency, Morse code can be sent by improvised methods that can be easily "keyed" 
                    on and off, making it one of the simplest and most versatile methods of telecommunication. 
                    The most common distress signal is SOS – three dots, three dashes, and three dots – 
                    internationally recognized by treaty.
